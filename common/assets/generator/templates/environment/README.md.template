# .env files

.env files in this directory and any sub-directories are loaded before executing services or commands script(s).
The variables they contain are defined as environment variables in the container.

Files are loaded in alphabetical order, and variables are overwrite if already defined in a previous file.

**Container environment variables will overwrite value possibly defined in .env files.**
